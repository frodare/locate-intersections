# locate-intersections

A TypeScript library to find intersections of an array of lines. Intersections are found using a sweepline algorithm heavily inspired from [`sweepline-intersections`](https://github.com/rowanwins/sweepline-intersections). 

This library diverges from `sweepline-intersections` in two ways:

- intersection data includes the vertex index numbers where the intersection occurred
- there are no ties to geospatial data or data structures
